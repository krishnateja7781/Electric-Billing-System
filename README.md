The Electric Billing System project automates the process of managing electricity consumption, calculating bills, and generating invoices for customers. It simulates a real-world electricity billing process, where users can record meter readings, calculate energy consumption, and generate bills based on predefined tariff rates. The system is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, reducing the manual workload for both customers and service providers.

Key Features:
Customer Management:

Add Customers: Allows the addition of new customer details (e.g., name, address, meter number).
Manage Customer Information: Easily update or delete customer information when necessary.
Meter Reading and Bill Calculation:

Record Meter Readings: Track electricity consumption by recording meter readings periodically.
Units Consumed Calculation: The system calculates the number of units consumed based on the difference between the current and previous readings.
Tariff Application: Different tariff rates are applied based on consumption brackets (e.g., lower rates for smaller consumption and higher rates for larger consumption).
Bill Generation:

Bill Generation: Automatically generate bills for customers based on their usage and applicable tariff rates.
Bill Details: The bill includes customer details, units consumed, the total amount to be paid, and the due date for payment.
User-Friendly Interface:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The system provides an intuitive interface for users to easily manage customer details, input meter readings, and generate bills.
Bill History: View historical bills for customers to track previous consumption and payments.
File Handling:

Store Customer Data: Customer information and bills are stored using file handling techniques (could use flat files, databases, or cloud storage based on implementation).
Persistent Data: Data remains saved even after the application is closed, allowing for continuous use.
Reports and Analytics:

Generate Reports: The system can generate reports for service providers, showing total consumption, total revenue, and pending payments.
Track Payments: Track the payment status for each customer, ensuring timely follow-up for unpaid bills.
Learning Outcomes:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project provides a hands-on experience in using classes and objects for organizing data and functionalities.
File Handling: Learn how to store and retrieve customer data and bill information from files or databases.
Flow Control: Utilize conditional statements, loops, and other programming constructs to process and calculate bills based on the consumption.
Java GUI: Understand how to design user interfaces and work with Java-based GUI tools for better user interaction.
Technologies and Tools Used:
Java Programming: For the core functionality and logic implementation.
Swing or JavaFX: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
File Handling Techniques: For storing and reading customer data and bills.
Optional: Could be enhanced with database integration (e.g., MySQL or SQLite) for better data management.
Real-World Applications:
Electricity Providers: Small electricity providers can use this system to streamline their operations, manage customers, generate bills, and track payments.
Society and Apartment Complexes: The system can be used by society management systems to calculate electricity bills for individual apartments based on their usage.
Hotels and Guest Houses: Hotels and guest houses can use the system to calculate electricity usage for each guest or room based on meter readings.
Smart Metering Systems: The system could be integrated with smart meters for real-time reading and automated billing.
